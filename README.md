# Program for Seed Sowing Robot

If a greenhouse were to be built on the roofs of the buildings it could be easily used to cultivate plants to suit the gastronomical needs of the people in that particular residential complex, making it a self sustained society of sorts.

Our project is part of an even large project, called e-Yantra, by IIT-Bombay. Engineering Students from all over India came together to create different kinds of robots for the purpose of an automated greenhouse to grow plants. The different themes were Seed Sowing, Fertilizer Deposition, Weed Removal and Fruit Plucking.

The robot we created was an Autonomous Seed Sowing Robot. We had the good fortune of winning the 3rd POSITION for this competition. 
The video posted here is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I3N8_3ZETE&feature=youtu.be) we recorded at the time of the competition.

* This robot is capable of autonomously detecting the size of the greenhouse, the length of each aisle and the presence of holes/flower pots and dropping a predefined number of seeds as decided by the farmer.

* The robot independently finds holes on either side of the black path on the ground (which is used to guide it through the greenhouse) and in order to save time, it deposits seeds on either side when it detects two holes very close by.

* The type of seed which can be dropped may vary from the type of plant to be grown. Therefore our Robot is fitted with detachable collectors which can be changed for different seeds. 

* The most difficult challenge that we had to overcome during this project was the design of the collection mechanism for the seeds.

We wanted a design that would be very user friendly and time saving for the farmers. After months of brain-cracking and planning, we designed an appropriate collection and deposition unit (especially for large seeds). The farmer need only pour the seeds into the robots seed reservoir and switch on the robot, rather than individually put the seeds into the robot one-by-one which is an unnecessary waste of time. The robot takes over from there.
